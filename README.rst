Allows the player to mark a bed as a "Hot Bunk". Hot bunks are automatically unassigned when a pawn exits the bed. Allows multiple pawns to share the same bed as long as their sleep schedules are different.

Select a bed. Mark it as a hot bunk. Any pawn that uses the bed will unassign it when they exit the bed.
